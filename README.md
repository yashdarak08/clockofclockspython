# Clock of Clocks (Python)

A Python implementation of the [Clock of Clocks](https://github.com/githyperplexed/clock-of-clocks) concept using Pygame.

I have written main.py on my own (do python main.py to run) but as Claude is better at coding than I am, directory strcuture goes brrr.

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
```bash
python src/app.py
```
 
## Project Structure

- `src/` - Main application code
- `config.py` - Configuration settings
